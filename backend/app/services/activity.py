"""Activity business service.

Transaction Management Architecture:
- Service layer contains business logic only (no transaction management)
- API layer manages transaction boundaries via get_async_db dependency
- Transaction commits automatically on success, rolls back on exception
- CRUD layer only flushes (session.flush()), never commits

Pattern:
- API layer: Transaction boundary (auto-commit via dependency)
- Service layer: Business logic (no transaction management)
- CRUD layer: Data access (flush only, no commits)

Exception Handling:
- Service layer raises domain exceptions for business rule violations
- ApplicationValidationError for business logic violations (HTTP 422)
